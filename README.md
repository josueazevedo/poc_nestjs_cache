**Project POC Nestjs Cache Redis/Cache-Manager**

---

## Objective:

The primary objective of this Proof of Concept (POC) project is to explore and compare different caching strategies within a NestJS application. Specifically, we aim to investigate three distinct approaches for implementing caching within NestJS:

1. Utilizing the `cache-manager` package.
2. Employing the `cache-manager-redis-store` package for Redis-based caching.
3. Implementing caching with the `redisio` package directly.

This POC seeks to provide insights into the ease of implementation, performance, and effectiveness of each caching strategy within a NestJS application environment.

## Setup:

Before running the POC, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Additionally, have Redis server set up for the Redis-based caching approaches.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Provision container with Redis:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start:dev
   ```

## Caching Approaches:

### 1. Using `cache-manager` Package:

The `cache-manager` package provides a simple yet effective caching solution with support for various storage backends. In this approach, we'll utilize `cache-manager` to implement caching within our NestJS application.

### 2. Employing `cache-manager-redis-store` Package:

The `cache-manager-redis-store` package extends the functionality of `cache-manager` by providing Redis as a caching store. This approach leverages the speed and efficiency of Redis for caching within the NestJS application.

### 3. Implementing Caching with `redisio` Package:

For a more direct approach, we'll explore using the `redisio` package to interact directly with Redis for caching purposes. This approach provides fine-grained control over caching operations and may offer additional flexibility in certain scenarios.

## Conclusion:

Through this POC, we aim to assess the suitability and performance of each caching approach within the NestJS ecosystem. By comparing the ease of implementation, performance benchmarks, and flexibility, we can make informed decisions regarding caching strategies for real-world applications.
